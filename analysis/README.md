# Python Analysis

ALL ipynb files are under progress.

`functions/` -- a folder containing python files that help reduce code clutter on `.ipynb`

- `mentions_2_hashtags.py` -- this is a python function used to find the relation between mentions and hashtags

- `datamanip.py` -- this is a python script file that stores all the functions to reduce code on `COVID-analysis.ipynb`.
